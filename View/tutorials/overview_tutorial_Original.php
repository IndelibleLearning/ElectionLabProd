            The 2024 election is only weeks away, but the map is nearly set.
            Red states will likely vote for Trump.
            Blue states will likely vote for Biden.
            Only a handful of states are still up for grabs.

            These swing states can be won by either side.
            You will need 270 Electoral Votes to win the election.
            You have limited campaign resources of time, people, and money.
            Spend them wisely.
